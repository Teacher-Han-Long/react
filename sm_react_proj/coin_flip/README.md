Users can flip a coin by clicking a button.
The app keeps track of the number of flips, heads, and tails.
A painfully simple app, but maybe less simple than it seems.

Only 2 components besides App.
The pupose of this exercise was to practice downward data flow,
with a parent component (Cointainer) that keeps track of state, 
and a very simple child component (Coin) that displays the coin.

The coin images are selected randomly by a method in the helper.js file,
 and passed as props to the Coin component.

 Good Luck!
