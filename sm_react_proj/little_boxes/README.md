Boxes change color when a user clicks on them,
and the same color will never appear twice,
thanks to the help of a do-while loop in the 
"changeColor" method in the Box component.

The colors exist in an array as defaultProps, in the child 
component (Box).

This app is a precursor to a larger project I'll be doing soon,
working out some of the problems with this one.
